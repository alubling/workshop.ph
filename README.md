## Prehype Introduction

Prehype is a venture development firm. We do 3 things:

* We incubate homegrown startups created by Prehype partners and EIRs
* We build new startups in conjunction with the world’s leading corporations
* We invest in startups and deals that our network can add value to

Prior to the Internet, computers were were silos. Installing software on a computer meant inserting a disk and downloading the software to the hard drive of that computer. The Internet and network age has allowed software to permeate networks, live in the cloud, and allows individual computers to leverage the intelligence of a network.

Prehype’s has built an API to model the way we build businesses, and allow anyone to apply the collective intelligence of the Prehype network to build businesses in a better way.
