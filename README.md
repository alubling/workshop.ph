## Prehype API

Prior to the networked age of the Internet, computers were mainly silos. Installing software on a computer meant inserting a floppy disk and downloading software to only that computer's hard disk.

Businesses today are similarly built in relative isolation. In a perfect world, the building blocks of business would share a common language and be available on demand.

Rather than start from scratch on your own, you would be able to call on resources you needed to launch enterprises and increase your chance of success.

Companies would be able to...

Prehype is a platform for building businesses. It connects people and companies to the resources they need to build great new businesses. Those resources have been built and maintained by Prehype, and leverage the historical knowledge, resources, and people of the Prehype network.

## Workshop.ph

Workshop.ph is an API for accessing the Prehype process of idea generation and opportunity identification.

The process consists of preparatory research into a problem domain, followed by an intensive one week workshop that brings together domain experts, stakeholders, and Prehype network members to examine the problem domain and arrive at new business opportunities.

The output of Workshop.ph is one or several LPPs
